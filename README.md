# A-star
A* pathfinding algorithm (a.k.a. A* search algorithm) written in C++

This is an widely used pathfinding and searching algorithm; learn more about A* at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

OpenCV is not necessarily required, provided that you have found another way to convert input images into arrays which have the same format used in the example.

Since there might still be some problems in my implementation, so please feel free to give me any advice!
